A space A is exponentiable if the functor - × A admits a right adjoint
functor [A, -]. This means that for all spaces X and Y, there is a
natural isomorphism of sets

  C(Y × A, X) ≃ C(Y, [A, X]),

where C denotes the set of continuous maps. By taking Y = * so that
C(Y, -) is the underlying set functor, one sees that the only possible
choice for the underlying set of [A, X] is the set C(A, X). We
therefore define a space A to be exponentiable if C(A, X) can be
equipped with a topology for each X which is (1) functorial with
respect to continuous maps X → X' and (2) such that the evaluation and
coevaluation maps (which form the counit and unit of the
product-exponential adjunction on Set) are continuous.
