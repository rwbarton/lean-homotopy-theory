Non-definitional equalities between objects of a category can be
awkward to work with. For example, suppose we want to show that two
functors F, G : C → D are equal. First we need to show that FA = GA
for every object A of C. Then, for every morphism f : A → B in C, we
need to show that Ff = Gf; but the two sides of this equality do not
have definitionally equal types. We must either use recursion on the
equalities FA = GA and FB = GB, or use heterogeneous equality; either
way, proofs become more difficult.

The algebraic structure of categories provides a more convenient way
to keep track of equalities between objects. Namely, for each equality
e : X = X', there is an associated "equator" morphism X → X', which is
just the identity morphism of X (or of X'). We call this morphism
`id_to_eq e`. By composing with these morphisms, we can change the
domain or codomain of a morphism to a propositionally equal object,
allowing us to compare morphisms with non-definitionally equal types,
like Ff and Gf in the example above. The "equator" morphisms satisfy
simple algebraic identities, making proofs about them easy.
